# Help Wanted

Items marked with the `help wanted` label need to ensure that they are:

- Sufficiently actionable: clear description of what should be done
- Tractable for new/casual contributors: there is documentation how that type of change should be made
- Goldilocks priority: Not too high that a core contributor should do it, but not too low that it isn't useful enough for a core contributor to spend time to review it, answer questions, help get it into a release, etc.
- Up to date: Often these issues become obsolete and have already been done, are no longer desirable, no longer make sense, change in priority, change in difficulty, etc.
