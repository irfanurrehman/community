# Meet Our Contributors - Ask Us Anything! 

When Slack seems like it’s going too fast, and you just need a quick answer from a human...

Meet Our Contributors gives you a monthly one-hour opportunity to ask questions about our upstream community, watch interviews with our contributors, and participate in peer code reviews.

## When:
Every first Wednesday of the month at the following times -
* 03:30pm UTC [calendar link](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MGw2OHM5bGRranJwZjI3OHN1MTk2Y2pjYjggcGFyaXNwaXR0bWFuQGdvb2dsZS5jb20&tmsrc=parispittman%40google.com)

## Submitting questions and/or code for review/walk through:
### Questions:
* Day of on twitter - use the hashtag [#k8smoc](https://twitter.com/hashtag/k8smoc) after your question   
* Slack - Ask your question in [#meet-our-contributors](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/meet-our-contributors)


Questions will be on a first-come, first-served basis. First half will be dedicated to questions for contributors and the second half, we will pick a problem (in advance) for peer code review.

### Code snip / PR for peer code review / Suggestion for part of codebase walk through:
* At least 24 hours before the session to slack channel (#meet-our-contributors)

Problems will be picked based on time commitment needed, skills of the reviewer, and if a large amount are submitted, need for the project. 

## Call for Volunteers:

Expectations of volunteers:
* Be on 5 mins early
* Be prepared to give advice on contribution process, membership, navigating the kubernetes seas, testing, and general questions about you and your path to open source/kubernetes.
* We will be using video chat (zoom but live streaming through YouTube) but voice only is fine if you are more comfortable with that
* Be willing to provide suggestions and feedback to make this better!
