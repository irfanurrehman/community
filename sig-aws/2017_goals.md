# Kubernetes sig-aws Goals (2017)

# IAM improvements
 * We hope to offer a more seamless integration path to taking advantage of IAM roles in Kubernetes
 * We are looking at implementations such as [kube2iam](https://github.com/jtblin/kube2iam)

##### Statement

Kubernetes components now have the ability to take advantage of IAM roles. The process is intuitive and easy.

# Networking in AWS
 * We hope to offer a knowledge base for networking in Kubernetes on AWS
 * We will consolidate networking reports and metrics around Kubernetes e2e tests and grow our metric list over time

##### Statement

A user can go to a single public location, and see a side by side comparison of networking avenues in Kubernetes on AWS.


# Federation

* We need to improve and harden our federation support in AWS

##### Statement

A user can easily deploy, configure, and run a federated Kubernetes cluster across regions in AWS. There is at least 1 central knowledge base for this concern hosted within the community.
