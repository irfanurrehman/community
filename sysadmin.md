# Administering Kubernetes Systems

The Kubernetes community is supported by many systems - things like the
website, groups, test infrastructure, github bots, and so forth.  The
administration of these resources should be a volunteer effort and should be
equally available to anyone in our community.

As of July 2017 this effort has just begun.  This document will detail what
resources are available for community ownership and who is currently
responsible for them.

## Community managed

* kubernetes.io GSuite - this is primarily needed to create associated
  resources like GoogleGroups and the Google Cloud organization.  Accounts in
  this domain cost the CNCF actual money, so are not available for individuals.
  Three steering committee members will hold the keys to three accounts on the
  domain, which can be used to create `@kubernetes.io` groups as needed.
  Volunteers:
  * Joe Beda (@jbeda)
  * Brendan Burns (@brendandburns)
  * Tim Hockin (@thockin)

## Not yet community managed

* Twitter
* Google+
* Blog
* Slack
* GCP Organization
* Kubernetes.io DNS
* Kubernetes.io URL redirector
* Github bots
* Test infrastructure
* reviewable.kubernetes.io
* ...
